## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

We looked at the relationship of miles per gallon (mpg) versus vehicle length, vehicle weight, spoiler angle, ground clearance, and all wheel drive (awd) capabilities. Using R to plot the correlation between the various parameters, we can infer that the vehicle length, ground clearance, and awd are strongly correlated to mpg whereas vehicle weight and spoiler angle have a weak relationship with mpg.
